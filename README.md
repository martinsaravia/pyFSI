# pyFSI v0.2.0

This is the second version of pyFSI, a code for solving fluid-structure interaction problems.

# Usage

Create a folder in the cases directory containing the .json input file and an allrun.py which executes the solver. 

Follow the examples in the case directory. Currently we support three type of analysis: eigenvalue extraction, nonlinear transient and preCICE-Calculix-pyFSI transient.
